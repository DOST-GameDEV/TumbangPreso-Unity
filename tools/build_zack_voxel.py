"""Builds a team-authored voxel Person from a CC0 rig: new mesh, retargeted skeleton.

    python tools/build_person_voxel.py

WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHY IT IS A SCRIPT RATHER THAN A MODELLING SESSION.
`docs/Port_Plan.md` section 8 puts the twelve people third in the replacement
order and calls them "the largest job by far, because it is twelve rigs plus
animation retargeting". That cost is almost entirely the RIG and the CLIPS, not
the shape: the shape of a Kenney mini is a pile of boxes, and so is the art that
replaces it. What is expensive is keeping 32 authored clips working across the
swap, and that is exactly what a script can do exactly and a modelling session
cannot.

  KEPT from the base .glb   both skins, all 32 animation clips, the material and
                            the colormap atlas, and every bone NAME.
  REPLACED                  the vertices, normals, UVs and skin weights, and the
                            bone REST POSITIONS, with the clips corrected to match.

⚠️⚠️ THE BONE NAMES ARE UNTOUCHABLE. `CharacterVisual.BuildHandAnchor` and
`CharacterAnimator.ResolveChargeBone` both hunt `arm-right` then `arm-left` BY
STRING, and a miss is one warning in a match log and a tsinelas hanging in the
air. The seven names are the contract; where the bones SIT is not.

⚠️⚠️ AND THE REST POSITIONS ARE MOVED, WHICH THE FIRST BUILD OF THIS ASSUMED THEY
COULD NOT BE. That build authored the new character around the Kenney skeleton and
came out with a head 53% of its own height against the reference art's 25%, which
is not a stylisation of the reference, it is a different character. The assumption
behind it was that the clips pin the skeleton. `tools/glb_anim_channels.py` was
written to check rather than keep assuming, and the answer is narrower than the
fear:

  * `head`, `arm-left` and `arm-right` translations are NEVER keyed away from rest
    by any of the 32 clips. Those bones are free.
  * `root`, both legs and `torso` are keyed, by 4 clips between them, and every one
    of those tracks is an ABSOLUTE local position. Shifting the rest position and
    every keyframe of those tracks by the SAME vector moves the bone and preserves
    the animation exactly, because only the difference between them is motion.

⚠️ THE INVERSE BIND MATRICES ARE RECOMPUTED, NOT PATCHED. Moving a bone without
them is the failure mode with no error attached: the mesh skins against the OLD
bind pose and the character comes apart limb by limb the first time it moves. The
whole rest pose is pure translation with identity rotation and scale, measured off
the base file, so `IBM = translate(-worldPosition)` outright.

⚠️ LIMB LENGTHS ARE CHANGED SPARINGLY AND THE REASON IS THE CLIPS. These limbs have
no knee or elbow, so a clip's hip rotation sweeps the whole leg: doubling the leg
doubles the stride the animator authored. The legs here grow by 36% and nothing
else grows at all. The arms and head MOVE without changing length, which costs
nothing at all, because a rotation about a relocated shoulder traces exactly the
same arc it always did.

⚠️ AUTHORED HEIGHT IS PINNED TO THE BASE'S 0.7234. `CharacterVisual.PersonScale` is
a single constant of 2.38 applied to every Person, measured off the imported model's
AABB. A replacement authored to a different height does not get its own scale, it
gets that one, so it walks the arena at the wrong size. The check at the end of this
file fails the build rather than letting that ship.

⚠️ EVERY COLOUR COMES FROM THE PALETTE, NOT FROM A NEW TEXTURE. `Toon.shader` picks
a Person's colour from WHICH 32x32 cell of the 512x512 atlas a vertex lands in, so
authoring a UV at the centre of a chosen cell is how a box declares which of the
sixteen palette entries paints it. A bespoke texture would work exactly once and
then opt this character out of the recolour mechanism, the stun frost and the
two-band toon pass that the other eleven get for free.

⚠️ SLOT 8 STAYS DARK AND CARRIES THE FACE, the same hard constraint the Godot
generator aborts on.

ADDING THE NEXT CHARACTER: copy the four box tables and the palette, give them a
new OUT path, and call `build(...)`. Everything below the tables is character
agnostic. `Assets/TumbangPreso/Editor/PersonSwapProbe.cs` is the check that says
whether the result actually works, and it is worth pointing at the new file first.

# THE SKELETON, in world space at rest. See the module docstring for what is free
# to move and what it costs.
#
# Base rig, and the proportions it produces:   new:
#   hips     0.176   legs 24% of height        0.232   legs 32%
#   shoulder 0.288                             0.400
#   neck     0.343   torso 23%, head 53%       0.445   torso 30%, head 38%
#
# ⚠️⚠️ 38% OF HEIGHT FOR THE HEAD IS DELIBERATE AND WAS ARRIVED AT BY OVERSHOOTING
# FIRST. A pass at 30% put the head between this cast and a realistic one and landed
# as neither: 🧑 seeing it on the sheet, *"WTF IS THAT HEAD"*. The problem was not the
# number on its own, it was that the HAIR is most of this character's silhouette and a
# small head leaves it nowhere to go, so the mop flattened into a cap and the whole
# read went with it.
#
# The reference art carries a head and hair mass of roughly a third of the figure, and
# the eleven characters standing next to this one carry 53%. 38% sits inside both, and
# the height it buys back over 30% goes almost entirely into hair volume rather than
# into a bigger face.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ⚠️⚠️ THESE ARE THE BASE RIG'S OWN JOINT HEIGHTS AGAIN, AND GOING BACK TO THEM IS THE
# FAMILY PASS. See `_family` further down for the whole reasoning; the short version is
# that the numbers in the table above this block were always the target — legs 24%, torso
# 23%, head 53% — and this character had drifted to 32/30/38, which reads as a taller,
# thinner, smaller-headed person standing next to eleven who are not.
#
# ⚠️ THE BOX TABLES ARE AUTHORED AGAINST THE OLD HEIGHTS AND ARE REMAPPED AT BUILD TIME
# rather than rewritten. `WAS_HIPS`/`WAS_SHOULDER`/`WAS_NECK`/`WAS_TOP` below record what
# they are authored against; changing one of these without the other is how the boxes and
# the bones stop agreeing, and the symptom is a limb that animates from the wrong pivot.

# ⚠️⚠️ THE FILE'S OWN FRONT IS +Z, AND THE FLIP IS APPLIED AT BUILD TIME BY
# `FRONT_IS_MINUS_Z`. This was authored the other way round first, on the strength of
# `CharacterVisual.PersonModelYaw`'s note that "the rig wears its face on -Z", and
# the character came out with the back of its head where the face should be. That
# note describes a different space, and reading it as a claim about the .glb is the
# same mistake its own header says cost ten sessions on the Godot side.
#
# What settled it is a measurement, and it is repeatable: `tools/glb_face_side.py`
# finds the vertices whose UVs land in slot 8, which on a head is the eyes and the
# mouth and nothing else, and reports which side of the mesh they sit on. On the base
# rig they are at z +0.1596.
#
# ⚠️ +X IS THE CHARACTER'S LEFT, because the bone named `leg-left` sits at +0.08357.

# scene. Author against the BONE NAMES, never against which side of a screenshot

# ⚠️ IT DROPS IN AT 1:1 WITH NO TRANSFORM, and that is not luck. The donor's head spans

# character on the base rig's own joint heights, so the donor's head already fits the
# skeleton it is being attached to. Move the proportions off the base rig again and this
# stops being free.
#
# ⚠️⚠️ AND BOTH DONORS SHARE THAT SPACE EXACTLY, which is what lets a skull come off one rig
# and a mop off another. Measured, not assumed: `character-male-d` slot 15 and
# `character-male-a` slot 14 are the same shell to four decimal places, y 0.3432 to 0.6613
# at |x| 0.2268 and z -0.1624 to 0.1576. Every rig in the set is that shell plus its own
# second one. Check it with `tools/glb_mesh_dump.py` before adding a third donor.
DONOR_SKULL = "Assets/TumbangPreso/Art/characters/persons/character-male-d.glb"

# ⚠️⚠️ SLOT 13 OF THE SKULL DONOR IS DROPPED ON PURPOSE. It is his bald pate: y 0.3932 to
# 0.7218, which is the HAIR volume worn in skin. Keeping it is what left the mop nowhere to
# go. See the block above `HEAD`, including why the note claiming this took his jaw was
# wrong.
SKULL_SLOTS = {15: None, 8: None}

# ⚠️⚠️ THERE IS NO DONATED MOP, AND THE ONE THAT WAS HERE IS WHY. `character-male-a`'s
# slot 8 dropped in at 1:1 and gave a hairline that follows the skull, which no box can do.
# It also brought his HAIRCUT, and his haircut is a scalloped fringe across the brow:
# 🧑 *"the hairs sucks shiiit why does it have bangs"*. Every hair shell in this set has one,
# because they all belong to characters who wear one, and a box laid over the scallops only
# replaces them with a straight cut. This character's reference has no fringe at all.
#
# So `_donor_part` is still the mechanism and still takes a repaint, and the next character
# who DOES want a fringe should use it. This one draws its hair in `HEAD`.

# ⚠️⚠️ THE MOUTH IS BENT, NOT REPLACED, AND REPLACING IT BROKE THE FACE. 🧑: *"change the
# expression just a bit to edgy or nonchalant? the :)"*, then *"bro look at ur render u
# broke the face hahah"*. A donated head is a rounded ovoid: z 0.1596 is its frontmost point
# at the CENTRE only, and the surface curves away toward the cheeks. Two axis-aligned boxes
# laid across that plane punched out through both cheeks and showed their own side faces as
# dark tabs at three-quarters, the exact angle the character screen uses.
#
# The donor's own mouth triangles already lie ON that curved surface. Moving their vertices
# in Y alone keeps them there whatever the surface does in Z, which no box can do.
#
# ⚠️⚠️ AND THEN THE BEND TOOK THE WHOLE LOWER HEAD WITH IT. 🧑 2026-08-18, on the turnaround
# that followed: *"the jaw is gone and the face is so buggy now"*. The selection below was
# a HEIGHT TEST AND NOTHING ELSE, run over every triangle in `head-mesh`, so it caught 70
# triangles and 129 of the head's 375 vertices when the mouth is 8 and 10. Everything below
# y 0.45 is the jaw, the chin, the lobes of both ears and the collar of the neck, and all of
# it got crushed to 0.22 of its distance from the mouth's centre and then tilted by its own
# x. At the ear that is 227 mm of x against a tilt of 0.10, so one side of the head lifted
# 23 mm and the other dropped 23 mm: the jaw collapsed into a flat band and the ears sheared
# into wedges.
#
# ⚠️ IT ALSO COST A BUILD IN THE WRONG PLACE. The jaw went missing in the same hour slot 13
# was first dropped, so the drop was blamed and reverted, and the pate came back with it.
# The mop had nowhere to sit for one more build because of a bad attribution.
#
# THE SELECTION IS BY SLOT FIRST AND HEIGHT SECOND. Slot 8 is the ink, which on a head is
# the eyes and the mouth and nothing else, so `_slot_at` narrows 221 triangles to 20 before
# the height test splits those 20 into the two features. That is the same measurement
# `tools/glb_face_side.py` makes to answer which way a rig faces, and it is the only test
# here that knows what a mouth IS. A height alone cannot: the jaw is at the same height.
#
# ⚠️ THE COUNT IS ASSERTED BELOW so this cannot quietly widen again. A selection that grows
# does not fail, it deforms, and the failure is a screenshot away rather than a stack trace.
#
# The split is measured: on this rig the twelve eye triangles sit at centroid y 0.4714 to
# 0.5066 and the eight mouth triangles at 0.4058 to 0.4295, with nothing in between.

#
# The donated mouth is a FILLED BOWL, an open grin with its interior inked, and no affine
# bend of a filled bowl is a smirk. Flattening it thins the stroke until the shape vanishes;
# tilting it swings the bowl without opening it. The last attempt measured 51.9 mm tall
# against an eye of 27.1 mm, because tilt over a 90 mm mouth adds its own lift to the height
# twice over. A mouth twice the size of an eye reads as a grin whatever its curve is doing.
#
# ⚠️⚠️ AND THE FACE IS FLAT, WHICH THE NOTE THAT STARTED ALL THIS SAID IT WAS NOT. Every ink
# vertex on this donor sits at z 0.1596 exactly, eyes and mouth alike: it is an inset PLATE,
# not a patch of a curved ovoid. The claim that "two axis-aligned boxes punched out through
# both cheeks" was true of BOXES, which have depth and corners; it says nothing about a
# polygon lying in that plane. So the mouth can be authored outright, the same way
# `FACE_PIXELS` was drawn before the head was donated, and `PANEL_PROUD` keeps it off the
# skin by the same fraction of a millimetre.

# ears; the second reached the cheeks.
#
# So the selection is checked against the geometry rather than trusted:
#
#   * the counts are exact. Eight mouth triangles over ten vertices, twelve eye triangles
#     over sixteen, measured off this donor. A selection that has widened by even one
#     triangle stops the build.
#   * NOTHING outside slot 8 may move, at all. That is the whole class the jaw fell into:
#     slot 15 is the skull, the jaw, the chin and both ears, and no expression has any
#     business touching a vertex of it.
#   * the skull's bounds must be identical before and after, which catches a move of zero
#     length in the count but non-zero in the mesh.

# § THE CHAMFER.
#
# ⚠️⚠️ 🧑 2026-08-18, looking at the finished model: *"can we make zack a little less
# blocky and more like the original models? he's giving minecraft now haha"*. He is
# describing a real difference and not a tuning one. Every other person in this cast is
# a Kenney mini, and a Kenney mini has NO 90-degree silhouette edge on it: the head is
# an ovoid, the limbs are capsules with rounded ends, and the shading rolls round every
# corner instead of stopping dead at it. This character was built from axis-aligned
# cuboids, so every edge in its outline is a right angle, and a stack of right-angled
# cuboids in a palette is the Minecraft read whatever colours you put on it.
#
# The fix is to CUT THE EDGES, not to round the forms. A chamfered cuboid keeps the
# voxel language — flat facets, one palette slot per box, the same table above unchanged
# — while removing exactly the thing that reads as Minecraft, which is the hard 90.
#
# ⚠️ AND IT COMPOUNDS WITH `smooth_normals`, WHICH IS WHY IT IS WORTH SO LITTLE
# GEOMETRY. That function averages the facet normals meeting at a position. On a plain
# cuboid three faces meet at 90 degrees and the average is a corner normal that shades as
# a hard crease; with a chamfer there are now two intermediate facets between them, so
# the same averaging produces a genuine gradient round the edge. The character shades
# like the rest of the cast because it now has somewhere to shade.
#
# ⚠️ IT ALSO FIXES THE OUTLINE FOR FREE, for the reason `smooth_normals` documents at
# length: the inverted hull pushes along the normal, and a smoother normal field round
# an edge is a hull that closes rather than tearing.
#
# ⚠️⚠️ A BOX THAT SKIPS A FACE IS LEFT SQUARE, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE. The skull drops
# its front wall so `FACE_PIXELS` can draw into that exact plane, and the panel is a full
# rectangle. Chamfering the skull would shrink the hole to an octagon and leave the
# corners of the face panel hanging in space outside it — the same class of fault as the
# z-fighting `SKIPPABLE` was written to fix, arrived at from the other side. Four boxes
# carry a skip; they keep their corners and nobody can see them, because the only skipped
# face on the model is the one the face is drawn on.
#
# ⚠️ THE SIZE IS PROPORTIONAL, WITH A CEILING. A flat 20 mm cut is most of a chain link
# and nothing at all on the torso, so it is a fraction of the box's own smallest half
# extent, capped so the large masses do not turn into gems. The cap is what keeps the
# skull a head.
# ⚠️⚠️ 0.45 IS NEARLY A CAPSULE AND THAT IS THE POINT. 🧑 2026-08-18: *"still to blocky
# btw"*. At 0.34 a limb 124 mm thick got a 21 mm cut — enough to kill the hard 90 and not
# enough to read as ROUND, and round is what the cast is.
#
# ⚠️ IT MUST STAY BELOW 0.5. The bevel is measured from each corner inward, so at half the
# extent opposing cuts meet and the box turns inside out. The fraction IS the clamp.
BEVEL_FRACTION = 0.45

# stuff"*. Only the largest boxes reach the cap at all — the skull, the hair crown, the
# jacket — and those are exactly the ones whose silhouette is the character. At 0.030 the
# skull was cut by 18% of its smallest half extent, which rounds a chain link nicely and

    """Averages the face normals meeting at each position, in place of the flat ones.

    ⚠️⚠️ THIS IS WHAT MAKES THE MODEL LOOK LIKE THE REST OF THE CAST, AND THE REASON IS
    THE OUTLINE RATHER THAN THE SHADING. `Toon.shader`'s outline is an INVERTED HULL: it
    pushes every vertex along its normal and draws the back faces. With one hard normal
    per face, the eight vertices at a box corner push in six different directions, the
    hull tears open at every edge, and what should be a thick continuous border comes out
    as a thin broken one. Kenney's rigs ship smoothed normals, which is why theirs closes
    and the first build of this one did not.
    🧑: *"GIVE it the same toon vibe as well as my other shi"*.

    ⚠️ AND IT COSTS NOTHING THAT MATTERS. The voxel read comes from the SILHOUETTE and
    from each face being one flat palette colour, neither of which normals touch. What
    changes is that the two lighting bands now fall across a box instead of stopping at
    its edges, which is the soft gradient every other character already has, and which
    the reference art has too.

    ⚠️ THE VERTICES ARE STILL SPLIT PER FACE. They have to be: a face declares its palette
    slot through its UV, so merging them would merge their colours as well as their
    normals. Only the normal is shared.

    ⚠️⚠️ THE FACE PANEL IS HELD OUT OF THIS ENTIRELY, IN BOTH DIRECTIONS, AND INCLUDING IT
    IS WHAT ATE THE FACE. 🧑 *"zach in char select is buggy, his face specifically is weird
    af"*, with the eyes reduced to diagonal slashes and the smile growing a tooth.

    The skull is emitted WITHOUT its front face so the panel can BE that face, which means
    its hull is open there and the only vertices on the front plane belong to the sides,
    the top and the bottom. Averaging those with the panel's own +Z pulls them FORWARD, so
    the outline pass — an inverted hull that pushes along exactly these normals — grows a
    black frame that leans in OVER the front plane instead of standing off the sides of the
    head. Its inner edge follows whatever the averaging produced, which is where the
    diagonal slashes come from, and it scales with the outline width: at the doubled width
    `ModelPreview` was passing it covered most of the face, and at the correct width it
    still cuts across the eyes.

    Held out, the skull's border vertices average only among the skull's own side, top and
    bottom faces, all of which point AWAY from the front plane, so the frame pushes
    outward as a silhouette border should. The panel keeps its flat +Z, which is what it
    wants anyway: it is one plane, there is nothing for it to be smoothed against, and its
    triangles face the viewer so the outline pass culls them outright.

    ⚠️ IT IS EXCLUDED AS A CONTRIBUTOR *AND* AS A CONSUMER. Doing only the second leaves
    the panel's +Z in the buckets still tilting every skull vertex it shares a corner with,
    which is the half that actually draws the frame.

    # `abs(height - 0.7234) > 0.002` and refused anything else, on the reasoning that
    # `CharacterVisual.PersonScale` is a single constant of 2.38 for all twelve so a
    # replacement authored taller "walks the arena at the wrong size".
    #
    # The constant is real and the conclusion from it was not. Measured across the twelve
    # CC0 rigs the port actually ships, model AABB height:
    #
    #     male-b   0.6613     male-a  0.6713     male-e   0.6760     female-e 0.7165
    #     female-f 0.6713     male-f  0.6713     male-d   0.7218     female-b 0.7234
    #     female-a 0.7755     female-c 0.7755    female-d 0.7755     male-c   0.7928
    #
    # They span 132 mm, a fifth of the shortest, and they all take the same 2.38.
    # `CharacterVisual.AlignToCapsuleFloor` re-measures the SCALED bounds and drops the feet
    # onto the capsule floor, so a taller rig stands taller with its feet in the right place
    # rather than sinking or floating. 0.7234 was one member of that range and pinning to it
    # was a transcription of the base rig rather than a family constraint.
    #
    # ⚠️ WHY IT MATTERED. The whole difference between those two ends is HAIR. A bald rig is
    # 0.66 and a rig with a mop is 0.78. Holding this character at the base's 0.7234 while
    # its donated skull already reached 0.7218 left 1.6 mm for hair, which is how four
    # sessions of hand-built cap ended up as a slab floating over a forehead. See the note
    # above `HEAD`.
    #
    # The bound is still a bound: outside the cast's own range this is a mistake, not a
    # style. It is widened by 5 mm at each end so a rig at either extreme can be matched.

    # ⚠️ EVERY BOX MUST BE INSIDE ITS OWN BONE'S REACH, or the limb tears when the clip
    # rotates it. A box hung off the wrong bone is the single easiest mistake to make in
    # a table this long and it is invisible until something moves.
    #
    # ⚠️⚠️ IT CHECKS THE REMAPPED TABLES AGAINST THE REMAPPED SKELETON, NOT THE AUTHORED
    # ONES. `_family` moves the boxes and `SKELETON` moves the bones, so comparing the
    # authored table to the new joint heights measures a distance that exists in neither
    # the file nor the model — it fired on `hair-fringe` the first time this ran, for a
    # box that had not moved relative to its own bone at all.
    #
    # ⚠️ AND THE BOUND IS PER BONE, because the head is now 53% of the figure. A crown box
    # is legitimately 0.38 from the head joint on a rig built to these proportions, which
    # a flat 0.30 calls a mistake. The head's bound is its own height plus a margin; every
    # other bone keeps the original number.
    # ⚠️ THE HEAD'S BOUND COMES OFF THE CAST'S TALLEST RIG, NOT OFF `NOW_TOP`. Same
    # correction as the height check above and for the same reason: `NOW_TOP` is the base
    # rig's own total, and a mop is legitimately taller than the base rig is. `character-
    # male-c` reaches 0.7928 with the head joint at 0.343, so 0.450 is a real box on a real
    # character, and this fired on `hair-curl-b` at 0.439 for a crown lump that is exactly
    # where the reference art puts it. 5% of margin over the tallest thing the cast ships.
